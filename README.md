# Semi-supervised-anomaly-detection

In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection technique for unlabeled data. Our framework is based on DBSCAN and LightGBM. To detect anomalies using our framework, user needs to import the unlabelled data into Python and has to name it as $X$.
